# Application of Transfer Learning to Biomedical Images
 
In the digital age, even in medicine, numerous images are produced every day and, despite their classification, the segmentation and recognition of objects are less detailed. With the recent development of artificial intelligence and convolutional neural network algorithms it is possible to achieve excellent results. This article analyzes the neural network differences in Matlab and the ability to recognize cells in light microscopy. The possibility of segmenting the border and internal area is also introduced, extending the algorithm in microscopy to the recognition of moles for dermatoscopy.
