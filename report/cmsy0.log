Uh, oh. A little while ago one of the quantities that I was
computing got too large, so I'm afraid your answers will be
somewhat askew. You'll probably have to adopt different
tactics next time. But I shall try to carry on anyway.

I'm zeroing this one. Proceed, with fingers crossed.

At least one of the coordinates in the path I'm about to
digitize was really huge (potentially bigger than 4095).
So I've cut it back to the maximum size.
The results will probably be pretty wild.
